## Learning Journey
### My Telok Blangah Heritage Tour

###### _#Bicentennial_

My Telok Blangah heritage tour traces the 700-year history of Singapore as a prosperous port city at the southern tip of Peninsula Malaysia, from a trading emporium founded by the legendary Sang Nila Utama in 1299, to a pirate-infested free port established by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819 and a modern metropolis in the 21st century. The tour features an array of national monuments and historical sites including Masjid Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim, Radin Mas Ayu, Bukit Kasita and Church of St Teresa.
