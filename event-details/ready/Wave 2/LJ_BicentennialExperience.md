## Learning Journey
### From Singapore to Singaporean: The Bicentennial Experience

###### _# Bicentennial_ 

Singapore’s history spans over 700 years. Even as we commemorate the arrival of Raffles in 1819, we want to take this opportunity to go further back another 500 years to 1299 for a longer view of our history. 

As the centrepiece event of the commemoration in 2019, The Bicentennial Experience will highlight key moments in Singapore’s evolution from 1299, how we had responded to, and been part of, regional and global influences and events. 

Your visit will begin with the Time Traveller which is a timed and guided audio-visual experience within the Fort Canning Centre that will take 1 hour. This will be followed by the Pathfinder, a free and easy experience comprising interactive pavilions within the greenery of Fort Gate where you will spend another 45 minutes or more.
