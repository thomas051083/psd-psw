## Learning Journey
### Transforming Visitors into Players: Enhancing Citizen Engagement Through Games at the National Gallery Singapore

###### _#Engage_ 

How do we transform the way visitors engage with art, visually, spatially, and socially? National Gallery Singapore consulted with Living Theories, a specialist company in game experiences and gamification strategy, to experiment with experiences for the Gallery, in both general visitor and student engagement. Run through an exciting one hour Gallery Game experience, followed by a post-mortem and sharing session conducted by Co:Lab X, the innovation team at the Gallery, and Living Theories, the experience builders.
