## Learning Activity
### Fireside Chat with Lai Chung Han, Permanent Secretary (Ministry of Education)

###### _#Engage #SPSPride_

We aspire for the Public Service to not just ‘work for’ but also ‘work with’ citizens. What does this mean to you and your domain? Even as you work hard to deliver good policies and programmes, how do we stay connected to the lived realities of our fellow Singaporeans? Exchange views with PS Chung Han, who chairs the Public Sector Transformation - Committee for Citizen Engagement (CCE). The CCE aims to foster a strong culture of citizen engagement across the Government. As a bonus, find out how you as an individual officer can learn more about our citizens’ lives and partner citizens by volunteering on insightful and inspiring opportunities.
