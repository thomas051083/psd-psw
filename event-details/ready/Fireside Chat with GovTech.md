## Learning Activity
### Fireside Chat with Kok Ping Soon, Chief Executive (GovTech Singapore)

###### _#Innovate #SPSPride_

Service Delivery is the window to the face of the government. Our vision is to be a Public Service that is Digital to the Core and Serves with Heart. This means using data and technology to re-engineer business processes, and serving citizens with a personal touch, in a way that enriches their experience. 

Join Ping Soon, deputy Chair of the Service Delivery Committee (SDC), in a conversation on how the SDC is driving the transformation of service delivery across Whole-of-Government (WOG) through cross-agency collaborations on wrapping government services around citizens. This includes integrating frontend services, streamlining backend processes and policies, and more, in this exciting journey of becoming a citizen-centric digital government.
