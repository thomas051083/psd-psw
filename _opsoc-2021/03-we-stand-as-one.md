### We Stand as One
<br>
Public officers have been working tirelessly as one, especially with the recent tightening of Safe Management Measures.<br>
<br>
Have words of encouragement for them? Submit a video rallying public officers to stand in solidarity as One. Video entries can showcase the cooperation, cohesion and unity of public officers, or encourage public officers to be resilient and steadfast despite the challenging times.<br>
