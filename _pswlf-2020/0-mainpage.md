<br> For the first time, the Public Service Week Learning Festival is going fully virtual and we have partnered with the **[Amalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE)](https://www.aupe.org.sg/)** to curate the learning sessions for this year.

Work out your “learning muscles” by selecting from a lineup of virtual learning sessions hosted by government agencies, training partners, and/or a series of online bite-sized LEARN modules that you can access in your own time.

These virtual sessions and modules are curated for all public officers. You will hear from agencies on how they have demonstrated Our Core Competencies (OCC) and/or you can choose a LEARN module to develop your core competencies.

Learn what are the 3 Ws of Transformation, and join the ‘Insights from Outside’ sessions. Featuring guest speakers who are practice leaders in their respective fields, the ‘Insights from Outside’ sessions are windows to inspiring transformation journeys from the private sector. The three live sessions would also include candid discussions facilitated by senior public service leaders, to provide provocations on what success to them would look like for the public service transformation journey.
